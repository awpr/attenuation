category: Constraints
synopsis: Subtyping relations and variance roles
description: |
  This lets you coerce containers (among other things) from stronger types to
  weaker types with zero runtime cost when it's safe to do so, e.g.
  @[Fin n] -> [Int]@.  This primarily comes into play when using newtypes to
  impose additional invariants on existing types.
