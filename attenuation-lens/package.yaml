synopsis: Optics that decay to attenuations
description: |
  Given an Attenuation and a validation function, it's natural to wonder
  whether they can be combined into a prism-like value whose forward direction
  validates input values, and whose reverse direction is just an attenuation.
  The answer is yes, and they're implemented in this package.
